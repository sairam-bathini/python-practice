Here are some functions and definitions that are commonly useful for secure coding practices in Python:

1. **Hashing Functions**:
   - `hashlib.sha256()`: Generates a SHA-256 hash object for secure hashing of data.
   - `hashlib.sha512()`: Generates a SHA-512 hash object for secure hashing of data.
   - `hashlib.pbkdf2_hmac()`: Generates a key derivation function (PBKDF2) hash using a secure HMAC algorithm.

2. **Password Hashing**:
   - `bcrypt.hashpw()`: Hashes a password using the bcrypt hashing algorithm.
   - `bcrypt.checkpw()`: Compares a password with its hashed counterpart to verify correctness.

3. **SSL/TLS Functions**:
   - `ssl.create_default_context()`: Creates a default SSL/TLS context for secure communication over sockets.
   - `ssl.wrap_socket()`: Wraps a socket object with SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.

4. **Secure Random Generation**:
   - `os.urandom()`: Generates cryptographically secure random bytes suitable for generating secure tokens, salts, or keys.

5. **Password Policy Enforcement**:
   - Functions and definitions for enforcing password policies such as minimum length, complexity requirements, and expiration.

6. **Input Validation**:
   - `re.match()`: Matches a regular expression pattern against a string for input validation.
   - `re.fullmatch()`: Matches a regular expression pattern against the entire string for stricter input validation.

7. **Output Encoding**:
   - `str.encode()`: Encodes a string into bytes using a specified encoding (e.g., UTF-8) to prevent encoding-related vulnerabilities such as UTF-8 injection.

8. **Parameterized Queries**:
   - Functions and definitions for using parameterized queries in SQL or NoSQL databases to prevent SQL injection attacks.

9. **Cryptography Functions**:
   - Functions from the `cryptography` module for encryption, decryption, digital signatures, and key management.

10. **Authentication and Authorization Functions**:
    - Functions and definitions for implementing secure authentication mechanisms such as multi-factor authentication (MFA) and JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

Using these functions and definitions, along with proper coding practices and security measures, can help enhance the security of your Python applications and protect against common security vulnerabilities.
